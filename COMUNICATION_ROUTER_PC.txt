QUESTION:


Suppose I have a network of 2 computers, each having a private network address of 192.168.1.101 and 192.106.1.102.

For my public ip address, it is 10.2.10.172.

When I make a http request to google.com, my computer will send out a packet with source ip address of 192.168.1.101 to the router and the NAT will change it to 10.2.10.172.

My question is, when google.com gets the request, and sends the reply back to 10.2.10.172, how does the router knows which computer to route to? (192.168.1.101 or 192.168.1.102).

I was thinking about port number at first but I think that we could be browsing on the same website at the same time so I have no idea how it works here.


ANSWER:

NAT
If you are using static (one-to-one) NAT, the router will assign the 11.2.10.172 public IP to the first PC ( for example 192.168.1.101 ) trying to reach google.com. In this case, the two PC will not be able to communicate with google.com at once, because the only available public IP is already distributed.
The NAT table in the router:
11.2.10.172 -> 192.168.1.101

PAT
In your case PAT ( NAT overloading ) is the solution.
With PAT, multiple addresses can be mapped to one private IP. When a device initiates a TCP/IP session, it generates a TCP or UDP source port number to uniquely identify the session. When the router receives this packet it uses that source port number to uniquely identify the translation.

Example
PC1 (192.168.1.101) makes an HTTP request to google.com (64.233.161.1) with a random source port number (1444). PC1 will send a packet with DA: 64.233.161.1:80 | SA: 192.168.1.101:1444. When the router receives this packet it inserts 11.2.10.172:1444 -> 192.168.1.101:1444 to the NAT table then changes the L3 addressing of the packet to DA: 64.233.161.1:80 | SA: 11.2.10.172:1444 and forwards it to google.com.
Google responds with DA: 11.2.10.172:1444 | SA: 64.233.161.1:80. The router receives this packet and translates it to DA: 192.168.1.101:1444 | SA: 64.233.161.1:80 then forwards it to PC1.

If PC2 (192.168.1.102) sends a packet with the same source port number as PC1 did , the router simply increases the port number by 1. In that case the NAT table would look like this

11.2.10.172:1444 -> 192.168.1.101:1444
11.2.10.172:1445 -> 192.168.1.102:1444

I hope it helps a bit.

UPDATE
As @CraigConstantine noticed, 10.2.10.172 is still in the private address space so I have changed it to 11.2.10.172.




ANSWER 2:


so you mean we will be having 2 port numbers in the packet? one for the NAT and one for the terminal (http port 80)???

Yes. The PC sends a packet with <dest: 64.233.161.1:80, source 192.168.1.101>. The router translates it to <dest: 64.233.161.1:80, 
source: 10.2.10.172:1317> and sends it to Google. Google responds with <dest: 10.2.10.172:1317, source: 64.233.161.1:80>. The router receives the packet, 
searches for the 10.2.10.172:1317 mapping in the NAT table. Finds the correct row, translates, and sends the packet to the PC with <dest: 192.168.1.101, 
source: 64.233.161.1:80> â€“ Adam Hornyak Mar 23 '15 at 7:00

If we want to get all technical (and who wouldn't?) the PC does assign a source port which is then translated by the NAT device.
So in Adam's comment the first source would really be more like 192.168.1.101:33123, and likewise 
the corresponding final destination at the end of his comment would be 192.168.1.101:33123.
